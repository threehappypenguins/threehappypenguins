## Hi, I'm Sarah! ðŸ‘‹

I have an avid interest in technology and recently started actively coding. In the past, I have edited code and made small contributions,
but began writing code after I started with writing scripts. I like to think up efficient solutions to problems, and coding is a perfect way
for me to implement what I want to accomplish.

I have a long history of curiosity, wanting to understand how things work, fix things, build things, and pick things up easily. As a child, 
I could pick up any new instrument and begin to play by ear. I learned to fix things at a young age. My favourite tape recorder stopped working, 
so I found a screwdriver, took it apart, and noticed a loose wire. When I would touch the wire to the board, suddenly the reels would spin. 
Success! My dad soldered it back on; good as new. I would look at an interesting idea and think, "I can do that!" My brother and I saw 
a [Beakman and Jax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can_with_Beakman_and_Jax) newspaper article in the comics (I'm dating myself here) 
about how lava lamps work. We took it upon ourselves to use a lamp without a shade, a mason jar, a coil, some water and wax, and copious 
amounts of duct tape, and built ourselves a lava lamp. It didn't work, we could have possibly electrocuted ourselves, and my dad was mad, 
but it was a great learning experience. My "I can do that!" attitude earned me two broken arms simultaneously as well, but I won't go into 
the details on that one. Let's just say it involved the schoolyard, competitiveness with boys, and soccer posts.

As an adult, I learned to fix things myself to save money, including my own vehicles. I need a strut. I'll go to the junk yard and get one and install it. 
I think my starter motor is done. I'll take it out and hook up some alligator clips to a battery to see if it's the problem. Yep. Install a rebuilt one.
I really need a dishwasher. I'll add a dishwasher wye to the drainage under the sink, install a shutoff valve and tee, and run PEX to the planned 
dishwasher area. I'll drill through the joists in the basement, and run 14/2 wire to a 15 amp breaker.

Jumping into something new and accomplishing it is nothing new to me. I'll figure it out. Just let me loose.
